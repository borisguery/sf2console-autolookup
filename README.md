Description
-----------

The idea of this little snippet is to be able to run the Symfony2 `console` from anywhere in the directory
tree, without the need to move on the right folder.

It is similar to `git` at use as it can be ran from any of the subfolder.

Installation
------------

Just clone the repository and move the file into `~/bin` (make sure it is in your `$PATH`) 

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/borisguery/sf2console-autolookup.git && cd sf2console-autolookup
$ mv sf2console ~/bin/
$ chmod +x ~/bin/sf2console
```

Usage
-----

Let's say you're currently in `sf2projectroot/app/cache/twig` for some debugging purpose
```bash
$ sf2console twig:lint somefile
```

It will run `sf2projectroot/app/console`

If you move into another project, you can re-run the same command and the according console
will be run.

Tips
----

This tip is not only applicable to this script but most of the little tools you may find.

Make a `bin/` directory into your home (may it be `/home/username` or `/Users/username`) 

```bash
$ mkdir ~/bin
```

Then add it to your `$PATH` env variable, in your `.bash_profile` (or whatever it may be)

```
PATH=$PATH:~/bin
```
